        <h3>Insights into Electoral Dynamics and Voter Preferences in the US Presidential Elections.</h3>

        <p>The data pipeline for this project was designed to handle large volumes of election data efficiently. Here's how the pipeline operates:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Data Acquisition:</strong> Data is sourced from official records and loaded into a preliminary processing system.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Initial data is cleansed to remove inconsistencies and prepare for analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Transformation:</strong> Cleansed data is transformed into a format suitable for detailed analysis and visualization.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> Transformed data is stored in a JSON format to maintain structure and accessibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Output:</strong> The final data is outputted through visual representations on various components of the website.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Prototyping and Feedback:</h3>

        <p>Throughout the development of this project, my goal was to simplify the interpretation of complex electoral data. The visualizations have evolved from initial sketches to a detailed interactive chart -- a map of the United States of America! The feedback from initial user tests led to several improvements, including the addition of contextual information to enhance understanding. Oscar Schiff '25 suggested including the percentages of which electoral votes for each state went to which candidate - a feature I implimented into my design. Wyatt Neigut '24 suggested the use of a color key on the initial map to label the candidates for those who may be unfamiliar with such information - another very important suggestion for clarity, and for the use of color and labeling for my project. I used a rectangular pie-chart to make clear the percentage vote of the whole total electoral votes, and I also listed that information on the page for each state numerically. Overall, I brought these factors together to form a full-fledged interactive Election map to show viewers the clear, direct results of the 2020 Presidential Election!</p>
